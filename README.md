# fitness-posture-detection-and-personal-artificial-trainer
To support the development of a healthier and more professional sports community, we have created a system capable of helping practitioners in detecting and correcting incorrect postures in real time. Our proposed system is capable of detecting fitness movements using an android phone. When users exercise, a live mobile feed is streamed to the server which has multiple connected modules to predict and output the accuracy of the postures. A stickman model with posture correction instructions will be displayed on the screen for users in real time to help them practice more accurately and intuitively.
